# TravClan Business Analyst Intern Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the TravClan Business Analyst Intern assessment, completed in September 2025. The project involved analyzing hotel booking data to generate insights, visualizations, and automated reports under a 16-hour deadline. Though I didn’t advance to the final stage, this experience sharpened my skills, and I’m grateful to TravClan for the opportunity.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL**: Wrote queries for trends, cancellations, and revenue analysis.
- **Google Data Studio**: Created 8 visualizations (e.g., monthly trends, city performance).
- **Excel/VBA**: Automated report highlighting with macros.
- **Project Management**: Delivered under tight deadlines.

## Project Structure
- `/sql`: SQL queries (e.g., `monthly_bookings.sql`, `cancellation_lead_time.sql`).
- `/visualizations`: PDF/PNGs of charts (anonymized data).
- `/report`: Summary presentation (PPTX).
- `/docs`: This README.

## Approach
1. **Data Setup**: Used PostgreSQL to create and query the `hotel_bookings` table.
2. **Analysis**: Built CTEs for monthly trends, window functions for rankings, and CASE statements for lead time bins.
3. **Visualization**: Imported SQL outputs to Data Studio for charts like Time Series and Bar.
4. **Automation**: Wrote VBA to highlight high cancellation rows (>20%).
5. **Delivery**: Compiled into a ZIP file with CSVs, SQL, PPTX, and PDFs.

## Challenges & Learnings
- **Challenge**: Date parsing errors in Data Studio—fixed with `PARSE_DATE`.
- **Learning**: Test data early and debug step-by-step.
- **Growth**: Rejection is feedback; I’m upskilling in SQL, Power BI, and Python for a stronger comeback in 6 months.

## Gratitude
Thanks to @TravClan for this learning opportunity. I plan to reapply after 6 months with enhanced skills!
